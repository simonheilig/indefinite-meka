# Memory Efficient Kernel Approximation for Non-Stationary and Indefinite Kernels (Heilig, Münch, Schleif)

## 1. Implementation Hints
This package extends the implementation of Si et al. (2014) and provides the experimental setups of the experiments presented in the main paper. 

Compile and Run the program:

- To compile the program, please type "mex -largeArrayDims mykmeans.cpp" in the matlab environment to obtain the fast kmeans. 

- Eigenvalue experiment can be found in "experiments/eigenvalues/setupEigenvalues.m"

- Classification experiment can be found in "experiments/classification/setupClassification.m"

- The main solver is located in "MEKA/meka.m", which is a extended and refactored version of Si et al. (2014)

## 2. Hyperparameters
Typical hyperparameters which are obtained in the classification experiments are listed in following table. Note that the overall rank approximation is _c_ times _k_, since the same rank per cluster strategy was used. The parameters are tuned with a grid-search and 5-fold cross-validation. The classification results were collected via a 10-fold cross-validation and the hyperparameter tuning was executed in each fold. Hence, the following Table provides just an excerpt of the utilized parameters. 

| Data Set | ID | _k_ | _c_ | γ | ρ | _p;a_ | _C_<sub>rbf</sub> | _C_<sub>elm</sub> | _C_<sub>poly</sub> | _C_<sub>tl1</sub> |

## 3. Kernel Properties and Preprocessing
The next table presents a brief overview of the different kernel functions used in this paper. We do not claim completeness of the listed properties and literature references but show information to support the relevance of an extended MEKA approach. The kernel properties of the Gaussian rbf and polynomial kernel are collected from [1] and in case of the other kernels the information are obtained from the first publishing paper. 

| Kernel | Properties | Publications | Preprocessing |
| :---: | --- | --- | ---|
|Gaussian rbf | γ ≥ 0</br> k<sub>rbf</sub>(x, y) ≥ 0</br>k<sub>rbf</sub>(x, x) = 1</br> infinite dimensional feature space</br> unitary-invariant</br> shift-invariant|introduced in [2] for the SVM; among other things it is used for kernel based methods on EEG signals [3], opinion mining and sentiment analysis [4], ground penetrating radar analysis [5] | [0,1]-Normalization|
|Polynomial|p > 0, q ≥ 0</br>"d + p choose p"-feature space</br> unitary-invariant</br> non-stationary | one of the first ocurrences was [6]; among other things it is used for termite detection [7], person re-identification [8], speaker verification [9] | L2-Normalization |
